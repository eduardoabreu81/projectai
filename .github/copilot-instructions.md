# Copilot Instructions
- **Project**: Next.js 16 App Router with TypeScript and React 19. Minimal template; no server components beyond the default layout.
- **Entry points**: Root shell and metadata live in [app/layout.tsx](app/layout.tsx#L3-L34); the landing content is in [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx#L1-L57).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 is imported once in [app/globals.css](app/globals.css#L1-L28) with inline theme tokens for background/foreground and font variables; prefer utility classes and CSS variables over ad-hoc styles.
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans/Mono are loaded via `next/font` and exposed as CSS variables in [app/layout.tsx](app/layout.tsx#L3-L26); retain these when adding components.
- **Theming**: Light/dark colors are driven by CSS variables in [app/globals.css](app/globals.css#L1-L23). Existing components use `dark:` Tailwind variants; keep new UI compatible with both themes.
- **Assets**: Use Next.js `<Image>` for images as shown in [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx#L3-L53); store static assets under `public/` and reference with absolute paths.
- **HTML structure**: Current page centers content with flex utilities and uses two primary CTA links; follow the accessibility patterns (semantic tags, `rel="noopener noreferrer"` on external links).
- **Config**: Next config is default and empty in [next.config.ts](next.config.ts#L1-L7); add options there rather than inline hacks.
- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` (ESLint 9 with `eslint-config-next`). Address warnings before shipping changes.
- **Dev/build**: `npm run dev` for local dev, `npm run build` and `npm run start` for production preview. No custom env vars or API routes are present.
- **Testing**: No test suite is configured; avoid adding test commands unless explicitly requested.
- **TypeScript**: Keep type safety in new components; prefer typed props and React.FC is unnecessary.
- **Tailwind 4 notes**: Use class-based utilities; avoid editing generated CSS. Keep global theme tokens consistent with `--font-geist-*` variables.
- **Routing**: App Router file system routing; add new routes as folders under `app/` with `page.tsx` and optional `layout.tsx`.
- **State/data**: No data fetching or server actions currently; introducing them should document expected shape and loading states.
- **Accessibility**: Maintain alt text on images and descriptive link text; keep color contrast in both light and dark modes.
- **Dependencies**: Only core Next/React and Tailwind. Do not add heavy libraries without justification.
- **Deployment assumption**: Standard Next hosting (e.g., Vercel); avoid Node-specific runtime hooks unless configured in [next.config.ts](next.config.ts#L1-L7).
- **File naming**: Use kebab-case for route folders, `page.tsx`/`layout.tsx` per Next conventions; keep CSS in [app/globals.css](app/globals.css) unless scoped styles are required.
- **Performance**: Use `priority` on above-the-fold images (see [app/page.tsx](app/page.tsx#L6-L19)) and avoid blocking synchronous work in components.
- **When unsure**: Align with the existing landing page patterns before introducing new layout systems.
